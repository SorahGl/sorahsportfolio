# portfolioProject.github.io
This portfolio projects website was created to hold some of my coding projects. As this was my first website that I designed and coded from scratch, I learned a tremendous amount and it was enjoyable to figure out how everything works.

## technologies used
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## attributions
This portfolio website was a project prompt from Codecademy.
Thank you to FontAwesome.com for their beautiful icons.
